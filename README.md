FIN is a simple and efficient Windows Forms application that allows users to easily browse a folder, view its items (file and folder names), and export that list to a text file. Perfect for users who need to quickly gather and save folder contents.

# Features ðŸš€
- Get Items in the Folder: View a list of all files and subdirectories (folder item names) in a selected folder.
- Export the List: Save the folder item names to a .txt file for easy sharing or documentation.
- Choose how you want to extract the data:
  - Only Names: Extract only the names of the files and folders, without the full path.
  - Full Path: Extract the full path along with the names of the files and folders.
  - Extension: Extract the file names along with their extensions, or full paths with extensions depending on your selection.

# Usage ðŸ’¡
1. Get Items in the Folder
Click the Browse button to open a folder selection dialog and choose a folder.
After selecting the folder, click the Get Items button. The application will display the names of all items (files and subdirectories) in that folder.
If the folder is empty, it will show <EMPTY FOLDER>.
2. Choose Extraction Option
Only Names: Select this option if you want to extract only the names of the files and folders, without any path information.
Full Path: Select this option if you want to extract the full path along with the names of the files and folders.
