# FIN (Folder Item Names Notifier) ðŸ“‚âœ¨
FIN is a simple and efficient Windows Forms application that allows users to easily browse a folder, view its items (file and folder names), and export that list to a text file. Perfect for users who need to quickly gather and save folder contents.

# Features ðŸš€
Get Items in the Folder: View a list of all files and subdirectories (folder item names) in a selected folder.
Export the List: Save the folder item names to a .txt file for easy sharing or documentation.

# Usage ðŸ’¡
1. Get Items in the Folder
Click the Browse button to open a folder selection dialog and choose a folder.
After selecting the folder, click the Get Items button. The application will display the names of all items (files and subdirectories) in that folder.
If the folder is empty, it will show <EMPTY FOLDER>.
2. Export the List
Once the folder items are displayed, click the Export button.
The application will prompt you to save the list as a .txt file. The file will contain only the names of the files and folders (not the full paths), making it easy to share or store.
